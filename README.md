# NLG-examples

Examples of GF-based natural language generation.

To test,
```
cd countries
make
open CountriesEng.html
```
Requirements: GF, GF-RGL, GHC

The countries example is based on data from http://www.geonames.org/

TODO:
- check all the Finnish and Swedish names (if possible, by extracting data)
- generalize the functions from countries to arbitrary types
- modularize the GF and Haskell code accordingly
